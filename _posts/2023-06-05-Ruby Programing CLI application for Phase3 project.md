## Lessons Learned and Areas for Improvement

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Throughout the project, I gained a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming principles and their application in building scalable and maintainable software. I learned how to design and structure code using classes, inheritance, and encapsulation to promote code reusability and modularity.

- **Database**: During the development process, I encountered various challenges related to database management. I learned how to design and implement efficient database schemas, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and optimize database queries for improved performance.
