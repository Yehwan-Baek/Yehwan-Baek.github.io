# Building the Backend Environment for an Anime Review Application

I will highlight the process of building the backend environment for an anime review application. As a developer, I took on the challenge of creating a robust backend system that enables users to review and explore their favorite anime series. This blog post will provide an overview of the key features, technologies used, and lessons learned during the development of this application.

## Key Features

- **User Management**: I implemented user registration, authentication. This ensured secure user access and allowed for personalized experiences within the application.

- **Anime Data Management**: To provide anime information, I integrated external data sources via API integration. This involved retrieving data such as anime titles, synopses, release dates, and genres and storing them in the SQLite3 database.

- **Review Management**: Users can create, retrieve, update, and delete their anime reviews within the application. I implemented these functionalities, associating reviews with respective anime and user accounts for seamless management and retrieval.

- **API Documentation**: To facilitate usage and integration of the backend API, I created comprehensive documentation outlining available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.

## Technology Stack

The backend application is built using the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Programming Language**: Ruby
- **Web Framework**: Ruby on Rails
- **Database**: SQLite3

## Lessons Learned and Areas for Improvement:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Throughout the development process, I deepened my understanding of object-oriented programming principles and their practical application in building scalable and maintainable software. I successfully designed and structured code using classes, inheritance, and encapsulation to promote code reusability and modularity.

- **Database Management**: Working with the SQLite3 database, I faced various challenges related to schema design, CRUD operations, and query optimization. This experience enhanced my skills in designing efficient database schemas and executing optimized queries for improved performance.

- **Authentication System**: One area where I further enhanced my skills was implementing an authentication system for the application. I learned the importance of securely managing user credentials and ensuring proper user authentication and authorization. I successfully integrated an authentication system, such as Devise, into the application, enabling user registration, login, logout, and access control for certain actions.
